# Validation limitations

The following cases are not claimed as fully validated by the current
staging environment as of 2026-08-27:

- The Kubernetes shutdown budget is checked arithmetically, but the revised
  `GF-REGIONAL-HA-007` still needs a staging run that holds legal 30/70/110
  second requests while a control-worker terminates. The current worker uses a
  130-second lifespan budget and a 240-second Kubernetes termination grace;
  exactly-once completion or explicit lease release must be proven live.
- The fatal processor deadline callback has not been run in a subprocess that
  verifies exit code 70, lease release, and takeover by a replacement worker
  (`GF-REGIONAL-HA-008`).
- Notification outbox behavior is well covered as a service, but the
  service-role/lifespan wiring that starts the production worker dispatcher
  has not been exercised end to end. Restart takeover while the provider is
  throttling is also unverified (`GF-REGIONAL-NOTIFY-006`).
- PostgreSQL-specific test count is intentionally not pinned in this document.
  Any test skipped because `GPU_FAULT_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` is absent means the
  default local suite is not a production Aurora Store gate
  (`GF-REGIONAL-CAP-005`).
- Remote commands have no command-level `max_waiting_rounds` or deadline.
  `GF-REGIONAL-CMD-013` successfully reclaimed the same command after each
  of 20 consecutive WAITING results, carrying the prior result details every
  time. A permanently WAITING adapter can therefore keep a workflow open until
  the separate workflow execution deadline intervenes; command-level
  dead-letter behavior is not implemented.
- `GF-REGIONAL-HA-006` measured the default executor-crash takeover delay:
  after the owning process was SIGKILLed, a completed Node Agent diagnostic
  remained behind the old 120-second command lease and reached terminal state
  125.981 seconds after the kill. This is expected by the current lease model
  but remains a recovery-latency limitation for time-critical actions.
- `HttpEventSink` now has a per-collector bounded disk outbox. Network errors,
  429 and exhausted 5xx retries are replayable; permanent 4xx records remain
  non-replayable. The residual limitation is bounded capacity, unwritable or
  damaged local storage, and replay being triggered only after a later live
  post succeeds. Completion Watcher critical failure/terminal events now use a
  ConfigMap-backed write-ahead outbox and replay independently after restart;
  its residual bound is the configured ConfigMap record/byte limit.

- `COLLECT-004` debounce was validated through the documented safe substitute:
  expected GPU count was temporarily set to 9, the first mismatch established
  a baseline, and the second sample 15.35 seconds later emitted the threshold.
  A physical GPU removal was intentionally not performed.
- XID154 `IGNORE` and XID74 reset-first were driven through real `/dev/kmsg`.
  The remaining destructive XID154 labels reuse already validated stop/reset/
  reboot execution chains and were not each repeated as separate physical
  actions. XID151 `RESTART_VM` was driven through real `/dev/kmsg` and mapped
  to a successful HyperPod node reboot. XID159 `CHECK_UVM` is applicable only
  to B100/GB200 and is `NOT_APPLICABLE` on this H200 fleet; a test must not
  falsify the product identity.
- Multi-cluster isolation is supported by the regional control plane, but the
  current environment has only one enabled, formally registered physical GPU
  cluster. A disabled temporary `b300-isolation-test` registration is not a
  second production cluster. The user explicitly deferred ISO-006/E2E-002.
- Provider node replacement is intentionally prohibited and is validated by
  configuration, IAM denial, and CloudTrail absence rather than by executing
  `BatchReplaceClusterNodes`.

No longer limitations after the 2026-08-11 rerun:

- BOOT-018 now compares source, wheel, node bundle, every running control/data
  plane process, release pins, and every live Agent by content digest.
- AUTH-015 now provisions per-node keys on the trusted deployment host. The
  GPU cluster contains no fleet master; installer Jobs and Cluster Executor
  mount only node-scoped keys, cross-node forgeries fail, and one node key was
  rotated without restarting its peer.
- HA-003 recovered from a real RESET=`LEASED` Aurora failover without duplicate
  action; restore, validation, and scheduling restoration succeeded.
- 8e/8f/8g/8h/8i were exercised through real events and cluster state.
- Fabric Manager journal used the production collector/control-plane sink,
  persisted its cursor, and did not replay after collector restart.
- Drill IDs now propagate from markers, XID/SXID raw messages, and node-health
  findings to incidents and notification subjects/bodies.
- DESTR-006 fail-closed preflight was exercised against an existing
  `NodeRecovery=Automatic` HyperPod without provider mutation.

These limitations must remain visible in acceptance reports. They are not
equivalent to PASS results.
